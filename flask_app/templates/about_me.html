        <p>
            Yup thats me, you're probably wondering how I got here...

            My interest in programming began in my small hometown's high school where 
            I took a CS elective. Intimidation set in from being the only girl in the class 
            and my record was tainted with a D from CS due to me skipping class. 
            As a stable career was insisted on by my parents, that is what I pursued until 
            I was done feeling unfulfilled and had gained the confidence to learn software 
            development. After messing around with HTML and CSS for a year, I joined a 
            full stack development bootcamp.

            Providing a win-win situation is always the goal where an organization is

            With a Bachelor's in Healthcare Administration and a decade in healthcare 
            operations, I have customer service and problem-solving at the center of 
            any work I do. It is exciting to bring my eye for efficiency and process improvement 
            into programming!
